# Node + SQL

Prerequisites for making the project completely working:
  - Have sql (or basically XAMPP) installed.
  - Have nodejs installed (fyi, npm comes with node itself)
  - Editor of choice (preferably VSCode)


Following are the steps to download and install the working project:
  - Clone or download the zip file of this repository.
  - If you want to clone then use
  ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/shra1dhar/IEEEUVCE_sqlSession.git
  ```
  - Or instead simply download it then extract the file to some suitable location.
  - Open the extracted folder in your VSCode ( **Ctrl + K** )

  - After opening the folder, open integrated terminal ( **Ctrl + ~** )

Install the dependencies in `package.json` and start the server.

  - To install all dependencies mentioned in **packet.json** file type
```sh
$ npm install
```
  - To run the server type the following command in the shell
```sh
$ node app.js
```
  - *You can also install another dependency named nodemon to avoid restarting your app everytime you make changes to the app using following command*
  ```sh
$ npm install -g nodemon
```
